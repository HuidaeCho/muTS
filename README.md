Microscopic Traffic Simulator (µTS)

## An open-source microscopic traffic simulator (µTS) using probabilistic estimation of vehicle behaviors

Emma Vail, Huidae Cho

As highway infrastructure and environmental land use take priority, traffic simulation and forecasting have become increasingly important. Experimentation with numerous road network systems and traffic data acquisition using sensors and other physical methods is typically costly whereas simulation technologies have paved the way for easier and more affordable traffic research. The objective of this project is to model a functioning microscopic traffic simulation that is capable of representing variations in traffic volume, patterns, and time. In this research, we will utilize various probability distributions to estimate different parameters related to vehicle behaviors. Microscopic vehicles will all maintain velocities that follow the normal distribution and their arrival and departure rates at a monitoring site will be modeled using the Poisson distribution. We will take an open-source approach using Python modules including OSGeo, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc., for microscopic traffic simulation. This research is relevant and significant in that one should be able to pair the simulation code with data and extensive outside research in order to better establish reliable predictions. For example, the code can be implemented with real-world traffic data to predict carbon emissions produced from different types of vehicles. We will present our final product called the Microscopic Traffic Simulator (µTS), which will consist of interactive Python code with the ability to predict traffic variability that can be used alongside other research to enhance and model the results. The result will have the potential to be extended to account for specific research variables and vehicle velocities that differ from each other.
